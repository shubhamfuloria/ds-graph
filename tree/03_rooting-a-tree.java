/*
 * Rooting a tree sometime useful to add structure to our problem
 * When we know the root of the tree, we can easily apply recursive algorithms to solve our problem
 * 
 * 
 * What is Rooting a tree ? 
 * Picking up a tree by specific node such that all the edges point downwards.

 * 
 * We can root a tree by any node. But we may not get a well balanced tree by choosing an arbitrary node.
 * 
 * In some situations it's also useful to have a reference pointer to the parent node, in order to traverse the tree upward / walk  up the tree.
